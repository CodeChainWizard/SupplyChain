## Introduction

This project seeks to transform traditional supply chain operations through the power of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). By combining the immutable and decentralized features of blockchain with AI capabilities for demand forecasting and supplier risk analysis, this system delivers a secure, efficient, and transparent supply chain management platform.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Incorporates smart contracts to facilitate transparent, tamper-proof, and automated transactions.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Uses machine learning models to accurately predict product demand, helping businesses optimize inventory levels.
- **Supplier Risk Analysis**: Leverages AI models to analyze supplier data, assess risks, and ensure a resilient supply chain.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Provides a seamless and intuitive interface for managing supply chain activities and viewing analytics.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`contracts/`**: Contains blockchain smart contracts for supply chain operations.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images and other public files.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes automation and deployment scripts.
- **`src/`**: Houses the main source code for the web application, including React components, pages, and styling.
- **`test/`**: Contains test cases to ensure the reliability and functionality of the system.
- **`ai_models/`**: Contains AI models for demand forecasting and supplier risk analysis.
- **`data/`**: Holds datasets used for training, testing, and evaluation of AI models.
